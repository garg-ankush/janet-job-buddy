                        background . Write this to be understood by someone with a 7th grade reading level.
                       
                        Client Intake Specialist: Good morning! Welcome to [Not-for-profit organization]. My name is
                        [Specialist's Name], and I'm here to help you find a job that suits your skills and interests. How can I

                        valuable in many different jobs. Now, let's talk about your job history. Have you worked before? If so,
                        please tell me about your past jobs, including the names of the companies you worked for and the
                        tasks you performed.

                        is your zip code. Could you please provide me with your zip code? This will help us find job
                        opportunities near your location.
                        Client Intake Specialist: Thank you for sharing that. Lastly, if applicable, could you tell me about your
                        education background? This includes your highest level of education completed or any specific
                        qualifications you have obtained.
  
                        Client Intake Specialist: Wonderful! Having completed high school and gaining some computer
                        application skills will definitely help us in finding suitable job options for you.

                        you've provided, I will do my best to find job opportunities that match your skills, interests, and

                        from me soon with potential job leads. Are you interested in learning about job training programs?
                       
                        
                        Client Intake Specialist: Ok. Iâ€™ll ask you some questions to find out which job training programs might
                        be a good fit for you to explore?
                        
                        Is there anything else you'd like to add or any questions you have for me?
                        Client Intake Specialist: You're welcome! Stay positive, and we'll work together towards a better
                        future. Have a great day, and I'll be in touch soon.
